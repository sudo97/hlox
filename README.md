# Lox Tree-Walk Interpreter

This project is an implementation of the Lox tree-walk interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The original book uses Java for the first part, but what is a sane developer's Java? Haskell, of course! It would be nice to implement the second part, which is originally in C, in Rust. As we all know, a good developer's C is Rust.

## Running the Project

This project uses Cabal, a build system for Haskell. To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Cabal if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `cabal build` to build the project.
4. Run `cabal run` to execute the project.
