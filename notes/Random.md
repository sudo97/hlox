# Random thoughts
This is for notes, that I couldn't find how to properly categorize.

## My secret motivational coach

Yesterday, I received an unexpected email. It was from an anonymous stranger who had found a solution I had posted here. I had pointed out that my own work is clumsy and inelegant, since it basically does the same job twice because there's no other way to propagate failure, but this stranger disagreed. His email address was a jumble of letters and numbers at @protonmail, giving no clues to his identity. All I had was a first name.

He didn't just critique my work. He suggested another challenge: a book called "Write You a Haskell". He mentioned that it has solution similar to mine, that I called ugly. It was a daunting proposition. Haskell is known for its complex type system, its myriad features, and its intricate compile-time optimizations. So naturally I didn't think I'm ready for something *that* complicated.

But the stranger believed in me. He assured me that I was capable of handling Haskell, saying that the book only assumes intermediate knowledge of Real World Haskell(the book), so about 10 chapters out of 20. His words were a balm to my self-doubt, a spark to my determination. I found myself believing him, believing in myself.

Thank you, Serhii. For your faith, for your challenge, and for reminding me of what I can achieve.
